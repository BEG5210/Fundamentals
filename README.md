# Fundamentals
This page is a repository for my VR game, and a documentation and recording of my progress. This is my first serious project (or development project project for that matter), and as of writing this, I LITERALLY have no idea what im doing. so im going to keep a log of my general thaughts and ideas each day, as well as what i worked on each day. I'm hoping to share my adventure from just starting out to making somewhat of a intresting VR game.

# LOG
## Day 1 - 27/6/'23
Today i got the urge to make a game in VR. i havent touched my headset in a while, but i thaught it would be a fun and intresting learning experience.
I've got the unity project up, and i named it "Fundamentals" i want to try and capture the basics of a genre, idea, or concept. just in general have something to do with fundementals. fundamentals of what? no clue yet.
