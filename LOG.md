Today i got the urge to make a game in VR. i havent touched my headset in a while, but i thaught it would be a fun and intresting learning experience.
I've gotten the unity project up, and i named it "Fundamentals" i want to try and capture the basics of a genre, idea, or concept. just in general have something to do with fundementals. fundamentals of what? no clue yet.
